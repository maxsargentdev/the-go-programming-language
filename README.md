# the-go-programming-language

This repository is for tracking my progress through the book:

***The Go Programming Language - Alan A.A. Donovan, Brian W. Kernighan***

---

In order to keep things sort of organised and add an additional element to my learning process, the repo is built as a cobra CLI app.

~~~bash
go build . && ./the-go-programming-language
~~~

This will show a list of commands.
