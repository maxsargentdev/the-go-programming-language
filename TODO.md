- [ ] Rearrange package structure so that it is as follows:
        - [ ] Chapter name is folder within ./internal
        - [ ] Sub-chapter is folder within that folder
        - [ ] One file per sub-chapter with all required code
        - [ ] This way exercises will always be grouped under the corresponding subchapter so looking up code is easy
        - [ ] e.g ./internal/arrays/arrays.go will contain code for 4.1 and 4.2
- [ ] Change command naming convention so that when we run ./the-go-programming-language, the output is correctly sorted
- [ ] Full refactorng pass and add unit tests
- [ ] Update README.md with instructions on running all exercises
